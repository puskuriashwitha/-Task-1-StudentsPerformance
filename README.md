# -Task-1-StudentsPerformance.
About this Task:
Hey! This task was all about cleaning and prepping the Students Performance dataset before using it for any Machine Learning models.

 What I did:
1 Imported the dataset using Pandas.

2 Checked how many rows, columns, and what type of data each column has.

3 Looked for any missing values in the dataset.

4 Converted categorical columns into numbers using Label Encoding.

5 Standardized the Math_Score, Reading_Score, and Writing_Score columns using StandardScaler to bring everything to the same scale.

6 Plotted boxplots to check for outliers in those score columns.

7 Removed outliers from the scores using the IQR method.

8 Saved the cleaned data into a new file named StudentsPerformance_Cleaned.csv.
